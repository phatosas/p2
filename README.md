## Demo

## Details
The webpage by default would generate a 4 word password seperated by spaces. However you have the 
option to reduce or increase the number of words used to form the password. You also have the option 
to use camelcase words or hyphens as seperators between words. If you enter a number less than or 
equal to one or greater than 9, it automatically defaults back to 4 words. Finally the website allows you append the 
password with a number and/or special character at the end of the password to make the password stronger. The special 
character and number are selected at random to add to the end of the password.
